## The typical environment files are
* These files are sourced for login shells: /etc/profile, ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.login, ~/.bash_login
* These files are sourced for interactive shells:  /etc/bashrc, ~/.bashrc
* 

## Shell types
* When you log in on a text console, or through SSH, or with su -, or putty, you get an interactive login shell
* When you start a shell in a terminal in an existing session (screen, X terminal, Emacs terminal buffer, a shell inside another, etc.), you get an interactive, non-login shell.
